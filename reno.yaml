      Replace this text with content to appear at the top of the section for
      this release. All of the prelude content is merged together and then
      rendered separately from the items listed in other parts of the file, so
      the text needs to be worded so that both the prelude and the other items
      make sense when read independently. This may mean repeating some details.
      Not every release note requires a prelude. Usually only notes describing
      major features or adding release theme details should have a prelude.
  features:
    - |
      List new features here, or remove this section.  All of the list items in
      this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so the text
      needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any information only
      available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean repeating
      some details.  Examples for core features and driver specific features:
    - |
      We can now limit the number of concurrent backup/restore operations that
      a Cinder backup service can perform using the ``backup_max_operations``
      configuration option.
    - |
      RBD driver: Added support for volume manage and unmanage operations.
  issues:
    - |
      List known issues here, or remove this section.  All of the list items in
      this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so the text
      needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any information only
      available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean repeating
      some details.
  upgrade:
    - |
      List upgrade notes here, or remove this section.  All of the list items in
      this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so the text
      needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any information only
      available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean repeating
      some details.
  deprecations:
    - |
      List deprecations notes here, or remove this section.  All of the list
      items in this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so
      the text needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any information
      only available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean
      repeating some details.
  critical:
    - |
      Add critical notes here, or remove this section.  All of the list items in
      this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so the text
      needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any information only
      available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean repeating
      some details.
  security:
    - |
      Add security notes here, or remove this section.  All of the list items in
      this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so the text

      some details.
  fixes:
    - |
      Add normal bug fixes here, or remove this section.  All of the list items
      in this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so the
      text needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any information only
      available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean repeating
      some details.  Examples for core code fixes, and driver fixes:
    - |
      `Bug #1889758 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1889758>`_: Fixed
      revert to snapshot not working for non admin users when using the
      snapshot's name.

      <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1889758>`_: Fixed
