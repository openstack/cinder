    def get_volume_stats(self, refresh=False):
        """Collects volume backend stats.

        The get_volume_stats method is used by the volume manager to collect
        information from the driver instance related to information about the
        driver, available and used space, and driver/backend capabilities.

        It returns a dict with the following required fields:

        * volume_backend_name
            This is an identifier for the backend taken from cinder.conf.
            Useful when using multi-backend.
        * vendor_name
            Vendor/author of the driver who serves as the contact for the
            driver's development and support.
        * driver_version
            The driver version is logged at cinder-volume startup and is useful
            for tying volume service logs to a specific release of the code.
            There are currently no rules for how or when this is updated, but
            it tends to follow typical major.minor.revision ideas.
        * storage_protocol
            The protocol used to connect to the storage, this should be a short
            string such as: "iSCSI", "FC", "nfs", "ceph", etc.
        * total_capacity_gb
            The total capacity in gigabytes (GiB) of the storage backend being
            used to store Cinder volumes. Use keyword 'unknown' if the backend
            cannot report the value or 'infinite' if there is no upper limit.
            But, it is recommended to report real values as the Cinder
            scheduler assigns lowest weight to any storage backend reporting
            'unknown' or 'infinite'.

        * free_capacity_gb
            The free capacity in gigabytes (GiB). Use keyword 'unknown' if the
            backend cannot report the value or 'infinite' if there is no upper
            limit. But, it is recommended to report real values as the Cinder
            scheduler assigns lowest weight to any storage backend reporting
            'unknown' or 'infinite'.

        And the following optional fields:

        * reserved_percentage (integer)
            Percentage of backend capacity which is not used by the scheduler.
        * location_info (string)
            Driver-specific information used by the driver and storage backend
            to correlate Cinder volumes and backend LUNs/files.
        * QoS_support (Boolean)
            Whether the backend supports quality of service.
        * provisioned_capacity_gb
            The total provisioned capacity on the storage backend, in gigabytes
            (GiB), including space consumed by any user other than Cinder
            itself.
        * max_over_subscription_ratio
            The maximum amount a backend can be over subscribed.
        * thin_provisioning_support (Boolean)
            Whether the backend is capable of allocating thinly provisioned
            volumes.
        * thick_provisioning_support (Boolean)
            Whether the backend is capable of allocating thick provisioned
            volumes. (Typically True.)
        * total_volumes (integer)
            Total number of volumes on the storage backend. This can be used in
            custom driver filter functions.
        * filter_function (string)
            A custom function used by the scheduler to determine whether a
            volume should be allocated to this backend or not. Example:

              capabilities.total_volumes < 10

        * goodness_function (string)
            Similar to filter_function, but used to weigh multiple volume
            backends. Example:

              capabilities.capacity_utilization < 0.6 ? 100 : 25

        * multiattach (Boolean)
            Whether the backend supports multiattach or not. Defaults to False.
        * sparse_copy_volume (Boolean)
            Whether copies performed by the volume manager for operations such
            as migration should attempt to preserve sparseness.
        * connection_capabilities (list)
            A list of capabilities that need to match the connector's
            capabilities when a connection is being initialized.

        The returned dict may also contain a list, "pools", which has a similar
        dict for each pool being used with the backend.

        :param refresh: Whether to discard any cached values and force a full
                        refresh of stats.
