"""
A mock implementation of a key manager that stores keys in a dictionary.

This key manager implementation is primarily intended for testing. In
particular, it does not store keys persistently. Lack of a centralized key
store also makes this implementation unsuitable for use among different
services.

Note: Instantiating this class multiple times will create separate key stores.
Keys created in one instance will not be accessible from other instances of
this class.
