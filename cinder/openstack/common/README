oslo-incubator
--------------

A number of modules from oslo-incubator are imported into this project.
You can clone the oslo-incubator repository using the following url:

  git://git.openstack.org/openstack/oslo-incubator

These modules are "incubating" in oslo-incubator and are kept in sync
with the help of oslo-incubator's update.py script. See:

  https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Oslo#Syncing_Code_from_Incubator

The copy of the code should never be directly modified here. Please
always update oslo-incubator first and then run the script to copy
the changes across.
