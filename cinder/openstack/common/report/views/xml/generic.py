"""Provides generic XML views

This modules defines several basic views for serializing
data to XML.  Submodels that have already been serialized
as XML may have their string values marked with `__is_xml__
= True` using :class:`openstack.common.report.utils.StringWithAttrs`
(each of the classes within this module does this automatically,
and non-naive serializers check for this attribute and handle
such strings specially)

    This view performs advanced serialization of a data model
    into XML.  It first deserializes any values marked as XML so
    that they can be properly reserialized later.  It then follows
    the following rules to perform serialization:

    key : text/xml
        The tag name is the key name, and the contents are the text or xml
    key : Sequence
        A wrapper tag is created with the key name, and each item is placed
        in an 'item' tag
    key : Mapping
        A wrapper tag is created with the key name, and the serialize is called
        on each key-value pair (such that each key gets its own tag)
