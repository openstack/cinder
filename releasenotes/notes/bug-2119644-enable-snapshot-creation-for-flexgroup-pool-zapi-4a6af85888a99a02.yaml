    NetApp driver `bug #2119644
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/2119644>`_: Fixed
    unable to create snapshots for Cinder volume that belongs
    to FlexGroup pool.
features:
  - |
    The NetApp driver now supports creating snapshots for flexgroup pools
    through ZAPI client and it utilizes the NFS generic driver. When it
    comes to REST, if the ONTAP version is below 9.14, the operation
    depends on the NFS generic driver. However, for ONTAP versions 9.14
    and above, it relies on the ONTAP file clone API.
