    `Bug #2111461 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/2111461>`_: Fixed
    issue preventing cinder-manage command to purge deleted rows due to
    foreign key constraint errors. This happened as timestamp for bulk
    delete operations were recalculated per table resulting in slighty
    different intervals for deleting rows on primary and dependents
    tables.
