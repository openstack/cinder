  - NetApp E-series (bug 1718739):The NetApp E-series driver has
    been fixed to correctly report the "provisioned_capacity_gb".
    Now it sums the capacity of all the volumes in the configured
    backend to get the correct value. This bug fix affects all the
    protocols supported by the driver (FC and iSCSI).
