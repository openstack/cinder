    Added two new configuration options to support region filtering in multi-region
    OpenStack deployments: ``backup_swift_region_name`` in the ``[DEFAULT]`` section
    for Swift backup driver region selection, and ``region_name`` in the ``[glance]``
    section for Glance client region selection. These options allow Cinder to
    correctly connect to services in the specified region when multiple regions are
    configured in the Keystone service catalog.

upgrade:

    Two new configuration options have been added for multi-region deployments:
    ``backup_swift_region_name`` in the ``[DEFAULT]`` section and ``region_name`` in
    the ``[glance]`` section. These options are optional and default to not filtering
    by region (backward compatible behavior). Deployers in multi-region environments
    should configure these options to ensure Cinder connects to the correct regional
    endpoints for Glance and Swift services.

fixes:
  - |
    Fixed the Glance client endpoint selection logic to properly filter endpoints
    by region when ``region_name`` is configured in the ``[glance]`` section. The
    previous implementation could incorrectly append endpoints when region_name
    was not configured. Now, when ``region_name`` is set, Cinder will only use
    endpoints that match the specified region. If no matching endpoint is found,
    it falls back to the first available endpoint. When ``region_name`` is not
    configured, Cinder uses the first endpoint (backward compatible behavior).
    This ensures correct behavior in multi-region OpenStack deployments.
