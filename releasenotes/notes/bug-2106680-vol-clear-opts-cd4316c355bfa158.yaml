    `Bug #2106680 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/2106680>`_:
    Configuration of the ``volume_clear_ionice`` option now behaves
    consistently with the other ``volume_clear_*`` options.  Keep in
    mind that the ``volume_clear_*`` options apply *only to the LVM
    driver* and only when thick volumes are being used.  See the
    `data leakage
    <https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/latest/admin/security.html#data-leakage>`_
    section of the `Security
    <https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/latest/admin/security.html>`_
    page of the `Cinder Administration Guide
    <https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/latest/admin/index.html>`_
    for more information.
