features:
  - Added a new config option ``scheduler_weight_handler``. This is a global
    option which specifies how the scheduler should choose from a listed of
    weighted pools. By default the existing weigher is used which always
    chooses the highest weight.
  - Added a new weight handler ``StochasticHostWeightHandler``. This weight
    handler chooses pools randomly, where the random probabilities are
    proportional to the weights, so higher weighted pools are chosen more
    frequently, but not all the time. This weight handler spreads new
    shares across available pools more fairly.
