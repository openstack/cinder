features:
  - Added support for oversubscription in thin provisioning in the
    ScaleIO driver.
    Volumes should have extra_specs with the key ``provisioning:type`` with value
    equals to either ``thick`` or ``thin``.
    ``max_oversubscription_ratio`` can be defined by the global config or for
    ScaleIO specific with the config option ``sio_max_over_subscription_ratio``.
    The maximum oversubscription ratio supported at the moment is 10.0.
