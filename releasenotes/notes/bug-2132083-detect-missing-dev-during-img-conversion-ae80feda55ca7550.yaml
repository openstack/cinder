    `Bug #2132083 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/2132083>`_: When
    creating a volume from an image, a storage connectivity failure or
    similar could result in the local block device node disappearing. In
    this situation, avoid writing the image to a file in /dev/ when calling
    qemu-img.
