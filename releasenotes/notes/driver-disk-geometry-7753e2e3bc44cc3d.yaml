    Added a ``disk_geometry`` configuration option to volume drivers that
    advertises each volume's ``logical_block_size`` and ``physical_block_size``
    to the guest. The default value of '512' is equivalent to the previous
    behavior of (logical 512, physical 512). The recommended value of ``512e``
    (logical 512, physical 4096) hints that 4k-aligned I/O is optimal while
    remaining compatible with older operating systems. This has the most visible
    impact for Windows guests that would otherwise submit 512-byte I/O, while
    Linux typically aligns to 4k already. On back ends such as Ceph, aligned 4k
    requests prevent extra read-modify-update cycles and can noticeably improve
    HDD-backed pool performance. Note that guests need a VirtIO driver that
    includes the fix from https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1428641 to
    use this feature (2019 or newer). The default value of the ``disk_geometry``
    option will change to ``512e`` in the 2027.1 release.
upgrade:
  - |
    A new volume driver configuration option ``disk_geometry`` has been
    introduced, which controls the ``logical_block_size`` and
    ``physical_block_size`` advertised to the guest. The default value of '512'
    is equivalent to the behavior of previous releases (logical 512, physical
    512). However, the recommended value of ``512e`` (logical 512, physical
    4096) hints that 4k-aligned I/O is optimal while remaining compatible with
    older operating systems. Beginning with the 2027.1 release, the default
    value will be changed to ``512e``. The current configuration value is used
    immediately whenever a volume is attached, however existing libvirt VMs
    won't be updated unless their configuration file is re-generated such as by
    detaching/attaching the volume, cold migrating the VM to another host or
    both live migrating (to update the configuration) and then later rebooting
    the guest (so that the guest re-reads the information from the hardware).
    Environments with Windows guests wanting to take advantage of this
    optimization may want to consider intentionally performing such operations
    to update the configuration of those guests and also ensure the guest VirtIO
    drivers are updated to a version from 2019 or later.
