prelude: >
    The default key manager interface in Cinder was
    deprecated and the Castellan key manager interface
    library is now used instead. For more information
    about Castellan, please see
    http://docs.openstack.org/developer/castellan/ .
upgrade:
  - If using the key manager, the configuration details
    should be updated to reflect the Castellan-specific
    configuration options.
deprecations:
  - All barbican and keymgr config options in Cinder are
    now deprecated. All of these options are moved to
    the ``key_manager`` section for the Castellan library.
