    Added a new cinder-manage command to handle the situation where database
    purges would not complete due to the volumes table holding references to
    deleted services. The new command makes sure that all volumes have a
    reference only to the correct service_uuid, which will allow old service
    records to be purged from the database.

    Command: ``cinder-manage volume update_service``

    When Cinder creates a new cinder-volume service, it now also immediately
    updates the service_uuid for all volumes associated with that
    cinder-volume host. In some cases, this was preventing the database purge
    operation from completing successfully.
