    Fixed the Barbican key migration code to correctly pass the region name to the
    Barbican client when migrating encryption keys from ConfKeyManager to Barbican.
    The migration code now reads ``barbican_region_name`` from the ``[barbican]``
    configuration section and passes it as ``region_name`` to the ``barbicanclient.Client()``.
    This ensures that key migration operations connect to the correct Barbican endpoint
    in multi-region OpenStack deployments.
