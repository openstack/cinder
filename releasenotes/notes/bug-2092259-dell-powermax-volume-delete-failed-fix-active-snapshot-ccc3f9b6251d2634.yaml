    Dell PowerMax Driver `bug #2092259
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/2092259>`_: Before
    a volume can be deleted, the driver issues a command to clean up
    active snapshots in the backend and then polls the backend
    to make sure the cleanup has occurred.
    This fix enhances the polling mechanism to give the backend
    more time to do the cleanup, thereby increasing the probability
    that the driver will be able to make a successful volume deletion
    request.
