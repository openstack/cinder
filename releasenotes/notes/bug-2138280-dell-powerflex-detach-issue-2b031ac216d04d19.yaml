    With the fix for `Bug #2138280
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/2138280>`_, starting from
    os-brick version 6.15.0 or later, users must retain the
    `/opt/emc/scaleio/openstack/connector.conf` file for volumes that were
    attached using the legacy flow prior to the 6.13.0 release, until all
    such legacy volumes are detached. For volumes attached using the new
    attachment flow, the `/opt/emc/scaleio/openstack/connector.conf` file is
    no longer required.

    PowerFlex Driver `Bug #2138280
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/2138280>`_: Fixed an issue where
    detach operations failed for volumes attached before the 6.13.0
    release that did not include an `sdc_guid` in the connector information.
    From os-brick version 6.15.0 or later, detach operations for these legacy
    volumes are handled by os-brick to ensure backward compatibility.
