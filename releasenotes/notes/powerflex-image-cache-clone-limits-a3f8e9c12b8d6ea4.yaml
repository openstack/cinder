    Dell PowerFlex driver: Added support for limiting the number of clones
    from image cache volumes. A new configuration option
    ``powerflex_max_image_cache_vtree_size`` controls the maximum number of
    clones that can be created from a single image cache volume. This helps
    prevent reaching PowerFlex vTree snapshot limits when multiple instances
    are booted from the same cached image. When set to 0 (default is 0),
    the maximum number of clones is limited only by the PowerFlex vTree
    snapshot limit. When the vTree size limit is reached, the existing cache
    entry is deleted and a fresh cache entry is created.
