    NetApp Driver `bug #2124264
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/2124264>`_: Pooling for the
    ASAr2 cluster is failing because it is using the ONTAP-9 libraries to
    retrieve the list of volumes and namespaces, and their sizes. The
    corresponding ASAr2 cluster libraries have been added to ensure the
    correct method is called, preventing pooling failures.
