If you would like to contribute to the development of OpenStack,
you must follow the steps in this page:
[http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html](http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html#development-workflow)

Once those steps have been completed, changes to OpenStack
should be submitted for review via the Gerrit tool, following
the workflow documented at [http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html#development-workflow](http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html#development-workflow).

Pull requests submitted through GitHub will be ignored.

Bugs should be filed [on Launchpad](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder),
not in GitHub's issue tracker.
