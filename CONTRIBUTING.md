If you would like to contribute to the development of OpenStack,
you must follow the steps in the "If you're a developer"
section of this page: [http://wiki.openstack.org/HowToContribute](https://wiki.openstack.org/HowToContribute#If_you.27re_a_developer)

Once those steps have been completed, changes to OpenStack
should be submitted for review via the Gerrit tool, following
the workflow documented at [http://wiki.openstack.org/GerritWorkflow](https://wiki.openstack.org/GerritWorkflow).

Pull requests submitted through GitHub will be ignored.

Bugs should be filed [on Launchpad](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder),
not in GitHub's issue tracker.
