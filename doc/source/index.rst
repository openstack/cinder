===========================================
Cinder, the OpenStack Block Storage Service
===========================================

Cinder is an OpenStack project to provide "block storage as a service".

* **Component based architecture**: Quickly add new behaviors
* **Highly available**: Scale to very serious workloads
* **Fault-Tolerant**: Isolated processes avoid cascading failures
* **Recoverable**: Failures should be easy to diagnose, debug, and rectify
* **Open Standards**: Be a reference implementation for a community-driven api

This documentation is generated by the Sphinx toolkit and lives in the source
tree. Additional draft and project documentation on Cinder and other components
of OpenStack can be found on the `OpenStack wiki`_. Cloud administrators, refer
to `docs.openstack.org`_.
