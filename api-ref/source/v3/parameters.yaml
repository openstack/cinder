volume_type_detail:
  description: |
    The volume type (either name or ID). To create an environment with
    multiple-storage back ends, you must specify a volume type. Block
    Storage volume back ends are spawned as children to ``cinder-
    volume``, and they are keyed from a unique queue. They are named
    ``cinder- volume.HOST.BACKEND``. For example, ``cinder-
    volume.ubuntu.lvmdriver``. When a volume is created, the scheduler
    chooses an appropriate back end to handle the request based on the
    volume type.  Default is ``None``.  For information about how to
    use volume types to create multiple- storage back ends, see
    `Configure multiple-storage back ends
    <https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/latest
    /admin/blockstorage-multi-backend.html>`_.
