      that a request to extend the size of a volume for these backends will be
      rounded up to the nearest multiple but the actual physical size of the
      storage will not be reflected back in the API for the volume size. For
      example, a request to extend the size of an 8GB ScaleIO-backed volume
      to 9GB will actually result in 16GB of physical storage but only 9GB will
      be reflected in the API and counted for quota usage.

    The volume type. To create an environment with

    ``cinder- volume.HOST.BACKEND``. For example, ``cinder-
    volume.ubuntu.lvmdriver``. When a volume is created, the scheduler
    chooses an appropriate back end to handle the request based on the
    volume type.  Default is ``None``.  For information about how to
    use volume types to create multiple- storage back ends, see
